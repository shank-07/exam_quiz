You are allowed to start the test whenever you want to. The timer would start only when you start the test. However remember that admin has full rights to disable the test at any time. So it is recommended to start the test at the prescribed time.
You can see the history of test taken and scores in the 'History' section.
To start the test, click on 'Start'.
Once the test is started the timer would run irrespective of your logged in or logged our status. So it is recommended not to logout before test completion.
